RestComm Client for Web allows you to leverage the telecommunication features of RestComm. It offers a simple yet efficient JS API that you can use to add rich communications capabilities to your Web Apps.

You access the communication features of RestComm Client through two main entities: {@link Device} and {@link Connection}.

{@link Device} is an abstraction of a communications device that can initiate/receive calls and send/receive messages.
{@link Connection} represents a media connection between two parties.
In order to get advantage of the event mechanism offered by RestComm Client you need to add callbacks to events that interest you such as incoming calls and messages.
